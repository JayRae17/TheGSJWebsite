                    The Geological Society of Jamaica is an organization of professional
                     geologists and persons interested in the geosciences that promotes 
                     and encourages the study of geology and its allied sciences in Jamaica. 
                     This is done through regular field tours of areas of geological interest 
                     and public seminars and conferences. Of great importance is the publication 
                     of these activities in our newsletters and journals of international 
                     standard for local and global distribution.

                    Part of our mission is to bring home the relevance of the application of 
                    geological knowledge to development in Jamaica, such as the identification 
                    of raw materials for construction and mineral resources, and information 
                    to be used by construction and development companies, as well as planners 
                    and risk managers in the banking and insurance sectors.
